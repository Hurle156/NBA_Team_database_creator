# NBA_Team_database_creator
A python script that webscrapes Data for an NBA team of your choice and creates a PostgreSQL database, with three tables including Team data, Roster info, Player data for each yer of the teams existance as found on Basketballreference.com 

You will need a postgres password to use correctly.

You will need the newest version of chromedriver and will need to update the chromedriver path to match your system.  

There are two files with mostly the same code as I prefer to write and edit code in Jupyter Notebooks before everything is consolidated into a single .py file.
